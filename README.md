This is a budgeting app designed for people who have a set weekly budget.

If you set your weekly spending budget to $100, $100 would be added to your
available funds. Every time that you make a purchase, you subtract that
amount from your available funds. Every Sunday, another $100 would be added into
your available funds. I designed this for my purposes specifically, but I
hope that somebody else will find it useful!
